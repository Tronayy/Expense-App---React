# ReactApp1
My first react app.
Following the instructions of Maximillian in his course "React - The Complete Guide" on Udemy.
It runs with npm start on vscode terminal after installing all the node modules using npm install.
The app runs on localhost:3000 which automatically starts on npm start command.
