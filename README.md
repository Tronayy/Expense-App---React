# ReactApp1
My first react app. It loads default expense information and collects additional details from the user. It shows a graphical view of the expenses done based on the year and the month.

## How to run?

The app can be run by:
1. Download the zip file and unzip it.
2. Run `npm install` in the main directory to install the node modules.
3. Run `npm start` to start the app on http://localhost:3000
